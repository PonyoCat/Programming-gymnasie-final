# Info
This was the capstone project for my programming studies. It is a beginner-friendly training app that uses a visual muscle map to show which muscle groups each exercise targets, while still giving users full freedom over what to train.
Built in Processing (Java). Exercises are retrieved from an external API, and the app logs a timestamped workout history in JSON.
